            <li><strong>🎉 4-5-6 INSTANT WIN:</strong> The best roll! You immediately win the round, no matter what. The round ends instantly!</li>
            <li><strong>⚡ TRIPS (e.g., 6-6-6):</strong> All three dice match. Deal massive damage equal to BASE DMG × (trip value + 6 bonus). Trips always score higher than points!</li>
            <li><strong>🎯 POINT (e.g., 4-5-5):</strong> Two dice match, one is different. The singleton is your "point." Deal BASE DMG × point value.</li>
            <li><strong>💀 1-2-3 INSTANT LOSS:</strong> The worst roll! You immediately lose the round. The round ends instantly - nothing can save you!</li>
            <li><strong>🔄 NO SCORE (e.g., 1-3-5):</strong> No matching dice and not 1-2-3 or 4-5-6. Both you and enemy automatically reroll FOR FREE until you get a valid combination. This does NOT use your manual rerolls!</li>

          <ul className="rules-list">
            <li><strong>🎲 ENEMY TURN:</strong> Enemy rolls first and attacks! Their Trips/Points deal damage based on their roll (80% of your base damage).</li>
            <li><strong>🎲 YOUR TURN:</strong> Click "ROLL DICE" to roll your dice, then choose your action.</li>
            <li><strong>⚔️ ATTACK:</strong> Deal damage to the enemy. Trips and Points deal BASE DMG × value.</li>
            <li><strong>🛡️ DEFEND:</strong> Heal yourself. Trips heal 5× their value, Points heal 3× their value.</li>
            <li><strong>🔄 MANUAL REROLL:</strong> Don't like your valid roll? Use a manual reroll to try again. You start with 1 per round - buy more in the shop!</li>
            <li><strong>⚡ KEY STRATEGY:</strong> Enemy attacks every turn, so balance offense and defense carefully!</li>

            <li><strong>💎 DOUBLE DOWN (30g):</strong> All trips deal 2× their normal damage. Combo with high trips!</li>
            <li><strong>📈 POINT BOOST (15g):</strong> Adds +1 to all your point values. Stackable!</li>
            <li><strong>🔄 EXTRA REROLL (12g):</strong> Adds +1 manual reroll per round. Stackable! Remember: "no score" rerolls are always free!</li>
            <li><strong>🎰 HIGH ROLLER (40g):</strong> Consumable — activate before a roll to force all dice to roll 4-6 that roll. Stackable!</li>
            <li><strong>🍀 LUCKY CLOVER (30g):</strong> 15% chance per level to reroll low dice towards 4-5-6. Stackable!</li>
            <li><strong>🛡️ DEVIL'S WARD (30g):</strong> 20% chance per level to reroll a die to avoid 1-2-3. Stackable!</li>
            <li><strong>⚡ FIRST STRIKE (20g):</strong> Consumable — use before a round to go first that round. Stackable!</li>
            <li><strong>🎯 WILD DIE (25g):</strong> Click a die to set its value once per round. Stackable!</li>

            <li>CRITICAL: 1-2-3 = instant loss, 4-5-6 = instant win. Avoid the former at all costs!</li>
            <li>High Roller is powerful but consumable — save it for tough rounds when you need the guaranteed 4-6 range!</li>
            <li>Wild Die is your insurance policy — use it to avoid completing 1-2-3 combinations</li>
            <li>Devil's Ward gives passive protection against 1-2-3; stack it for reliable coverage</li>
            <li>Prices increase as you buy more — plan your build carefully!</li>
            <li>Later rounds give more gold and better rewards — but enemies get much tougher!</li>

            Rewards scale up each round: Round 1 gives 20g, Round 2 gives 25g, etc. HP and damage bonuses also increase. However, enemy difficulty grows exponentially - later rounds have much tougher opponents! Powerup prices increase 5% with every purchase, and stackable powerups get 30% more expensive each time you buy them. Plan your economy wisely!
